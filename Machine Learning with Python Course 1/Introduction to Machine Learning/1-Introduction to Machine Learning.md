# Week 1

In this week, you will learn about applications of Machine Learning in different fields such as health care, banking, telecommunication, and so on. You’ll get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, and the usage of each algorithm. Also, you understand the advantage of using Python libraries for implementing Machine Learning models.


### Introduction to Machine Learning
#### Is this a Benign or Malignant cell?
This is a human cell sample extracted from a patient, and this cell has characteristics. For example, its clump thickness is 6, its uniformity of cell size is 1, its marginal adhesion is 1, and so on.

One of the interesting questions we can ask, at this point is: **Is this a benign or malignant cell ?**

In contrast with a benign tumor, a malignant tumor is a tumor that may invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body, and diagnosing it early might be the key to a patient’s survival.
One could easily presume that only a doctor with years of experience could diagnose that tumor and say if the patient is developing cancer or not. Right?
#### Machine Learning helps with predictions
Well, imagine that you've obtained a dataset containing characteristics of thousands of human cell samples extracted from patients who were believed to be at risk of developing cancer. 
Analysis of the original data showed that many of the characteristics differed significantly between benign and malignant samples.
You can use the values of these cell characteristics in samples from other patients to give an early indication of whether a new sample might be benign or malignant.
You should clean your data, select a proper algorithm for building a prediction model, and train your model to understand patterns of benign or malignant cells within the data.
Once the model has been trained by going through data iteratively, it can be used to predict your new or unknown cell with a rather high accuracy.
**This is machine learning!** It is the way that a machine learning model can do a doctor’s task or at least help  that doctor make the process faster.
