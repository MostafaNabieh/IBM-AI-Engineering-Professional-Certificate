# Machine Learning with Python  
The repository is the result from the course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python"> Machine Learning with Python  </a>

This course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python. 
In this course, we will be reviewing two main components:
First, you will be learning about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
Second, you will get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms.
